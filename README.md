# MACOS-ELTE-ORGANIZER

This is my own personal study folder organizer for macos. 
Currently to my best of knowledge, only 2026 ELTE student future graduates from Group 4 in their first semester can also use this.

<p>To setup the organizer, we need to create a config.ini file with our own data. You may use the config.py program to setup your data, or you can directly type into the example config.ini file. Also, to copy and moves the files around you need permissions. To get these permissions:<br>
SETTINGS -> PRIVACY AND SECURITY -> FULL DISK ACCESS -> enable for TERMINAL and VISUAL STUDIO CODE
</p>

Example data:

<p>[DIRECTORIES]<br>
Destination = /Users/chuluun/Desktop/testing<br>
Downloads = /Users/chuluun/Downloads</p>

<p>[SETTINGS]<br>
Move or Copy = copy</p>

<p>[LINKS]<br>
Basic Math = https://canvas.elte.hu/courses/36812 |https://ikelte.sharepoint.com/sites/BasicMathematicsGroup4 |
</p>
<p>
The data will have 3 sections. The required directory pathways [DIRECTORIES], setting for either moving the files or copying the files [SETTINGS], and the links for our data [LINKS]. When writing the links, make sure each link is followed by a space, and '|'. Each subject can have multiple links.<br>
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">I recommend creating a destination folder which you won't use in the future and use the setting copy. I haven't tested for enough bugs so please test before actually using the program.</span>
</p>

<p>
Each course for teams and canvas has a certain id after the given link above. For example:
My basic math subject link for Canvas is 'https://canvas.elte.hu/courses/36812' and 
for Teams it's 'https://ikelte.sharepoint.com/sites/BasicMathematicsGroup4/'</p>

<p>You can find the link for your subject by:<br>
Entering this website for TEAMS LINKS https://ikelte.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx
and for CANVAS LINKS https://canvas.elte.hu/courses<br>
Or: clicking on the downloaded file -> Get Info -> More Info -> Where from: 'LINK'</p>


When setting up configuration file, specify where you want the file
