# MACOS-ELTE-ORGANIZER

This is my own personal study folder organizer for macos. 
Currently to my best of knowledge, only 2026 ELTE student future graduates from Group 4 in their first semester can also use this.

To setup the organizer, we need to create a config.ini file with our own data. You may use the config.py program to setup your data, or you can directly type into the config.ini file.

Example data:

<p>[DIRECTORIES]<br>
Destination = /Users/chuluun/Desktop/testing<br>
Downloads = /Users/chuluun/Downloads</p>

<p>[SETTINGS]<br>
Move or Copy = move</p>

<p>[LINKS]<br>
Basic Math = https://canvas.elte.hu/courses/36812 |https://ikelte.sharepoint.com/sites/BasicMathematicsGroup4 |
</p>
<p>
The data will have 3 sections. The required directory pathways, setting for either moving the files or copying the files, and the links for our data. Make sure to write the data properly.</p>
When inputting the links, make sure each link is followed by a space, and '|'. Each subject can have multiple links.

<p>
Each course for teams and canvas has a certain id after the given link above. For example:
My basic math subject link for Canvas is 'https://canvas.elte.hu/courses/36812' and 
for Teams it's 'https://ikelte.sharepoint.com/sites/BasicMathematicsGroup4/'</p>

<p>You can find the link for your subject by:<br>
Entering this website for TEAMS LINKS https://ikelte.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx
and for CANVAS LINKS https://canvas.elte.hu/courses<br>
Or: clicking on the downloaded file -> Get Info -> More Info -> Where from: 'LINK'</p>


When setting up configuration file, specify where you want the file
